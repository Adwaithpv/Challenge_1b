# Approach Explanation

This project implements a sophisticated, persona-driven document intelligence system designed to analyze a collection of PDF documents and extract the most relevant information based on a user's role and task. The system's core methodology revolves around a multi-stage pipeline that combines natural language processing (NLP), semantic search, and extractive summarization to deliver a ranked list of document sections tailored to the user's needs.

## Methodology

### 1. **Content Hydration and Sectioning**

The process begins by ingesting PDF documents and their corresponding structural metadata from a preliminary analysis (Round 1A). This metadata, which includes titles, headings, and page numbers, is used to "hydrate" the content by extracting the full text associated with each section. This approach is superior to arbitrary chunking because it preserves the semantic coherence of the document, ensuring that the extracted text blocks are meaningful and contextually complete.

### 2. **Persona-Driven Semantic Querying**

The system's intelligence lies in its ability to understand the user's intent. It takes a user persona (e.g., "PhD Researcher") and a "job-to-be-done" (e.g., "Prepare a literature review") and formulates a descriptive semantic query. This query is not a simple keyword search but a rich, contextual representation of the user's information needs.

### 3. **Semantic Vectorization and Relevance Ranking**

To enable a meaning-based comparison, both the user's query and the hydrated document sections are transformed into high-dimensional vectors using a state-of-the-art sentence-transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). This model is chosen for its efficiency and accuracy, making it ideal for CPU-based execution within the given performance constraints. The relevance of each section is then calculated using cosine similarity, which measures the angular difference between the query vector and the section vectors. This method ensures that the ranking is based on semantic similarity rather than just keyword overlap.

### 4. **Extractive Summarization**

To provide a quick overview of the most relevant content, the system generates concise, extractive summaries for the top-ranked sections. It leverages the same `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for this task, which is a key optimization that significantly reduces memory overhead and improves performance. The summarizer identifies the most salient sentences in a section to create a "refined text" that captures the essence of the content.

### 5. **Optimized and Offline-Ready Architecture**

The entire system is designed for efficiency and offline execution. By reusing the same model for both vectorization and summarization, it minimizes the memory footprint and reduces processing time. The models are pre-downloaded and cached, allowing the system to run in an environment without internet access. The solution is containerized using Docker, which encapsulates all dependencies and ensures a consistent, reproducible execution environment.
