# Approach Explanation

This project implements a sophisticated, persona-driven document intelligence system designed to analyze a collection of PDF documents and extract the most relevant information based on a user's role and task. The system's core methodology revolves around a multi-stage pipeline that combines natural language processing (NLP), semantic search, and extractive summarization to deliver a ranked list of document sections tailored to the user's needs.

## Methodology

### 1. **Content Hydration and Sectioning**

The process begins by ingesting PDF documents and their corresponding structural metadata from a preliminary analysis (Round 1A). This metadata, which includes titles, headings, and page numbers, is used to "hydrate" the content by extracting the full text associated with each section. This approach is superior to arbitrary chunking because it preserves the semantic coherence of the document, ensuring that the extracted text blocks are meaningful and contextually complete.

The system intelligently handles hierarchical document structures (H1, H2, H3 headers) by mapping them to priority levels and determining section boundaries based on content flow. For each identified section, the full text is extracted from the corresponding PDF pages, creating semantically coherent content blocks that maintain the author's intended logical structure. This preservation of document hierarchy is crucial for maintaining context and ensuring that related information remains grouped together during analysis.

### 2. **Persona-Driven Semantic Querying**

The system's intelligence lies in its ability to understand the user's intent through sophisticated query formulation. It takes a user persona (e.g., "PhD Researcher") and a "job-to-be-done" (e.g., "Prepare a literature review") and formulates a descriptive semantic query using the template: "A {persona} needs to {job}. The relevant information is:". This approach transforms abstract user requirements into concrete, searchable semantic representations.

Rather than relying on keyword matching, this methodology creates rich contextual queries that capture the nuanced information needs of different professional roles. For instance, a "Financial Analyst" analyzing "quarterly revenue trends" would generate a fundamentally different semantic signature than a "Marketing Manager" planning "customer acquisition strategies", even when analyzing the same document collection.

### 3. **Semantic Vectorization and Relevance Ranking**

To enable meaning-based comparison, both the user's query and the hydrated document sections are transformed into high-dimensional vectors using the state-of-the-art sentence-transformer model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. This model is specifically chosen for its optimal balance of accuracy (384-dimensional embeddings) and efficiency (80MB model size, 14k sentences/second processing speed), making it ideal for CPU-based execution within the given performance constraints.

The system handles variable-length content through intelligent chunking with overlap, ensuring long sections are properly vectorized without losing semantic coherence. Relevance ranking is performed using cosine similarity calculations between the query vector and each section vector, measuring the angular difference in high-dimensional space. This mathematical approach ensures that ranking is based on deep semantic similarity rather than superficial keyword overlap, enabling the system to identify conceptually relevant content even when exact terms don't match.

### 4. **Extractive Summarization**

To provide actionable insights, the system generates concise, extractive summaries for the top-ranked sections using BERT-based extractive summarization. The system strategically reuses the same transformer architecture for this task, which represents a key optimization that significantly reduces memory overhead while maintaining quality. The summarizer employs advanced sentence selection algorithms to identify the most salient sentences within each relevant section, creating "refined text" that captures the essential information while remaining concise and readable.

This dual-purpose model utilization (embeddings + summarization) demonstrates sophisticated resource management, allowing the system to deliver comprehensive document intelligence while remaining within strict computational constraints. The extractive approach ensures that summaries maintain factual accuracy by using the author's original language rather than generating potentially inaccurate paraphrases.

### 5. **Optimized and Offline-Ready Architecture**

The entire system is engineered for efficiency and offline execution. By reusing the same model for both vectorization and summarization, it minimizes the memory footprint and reduces processing time. The models are pre-downloaded and cached, allowing the system to run in completely isolated environments without internet access. The solution is containerized using Docker, which encapsulates all dependencies and ensures consistent, reproducible execution across different deployment environments.

Performance optimizations include intelligent model loading, batch processing where possible, and memory-efficient vector operations. The architecture maintains sub-60-second processing times for typical document collections while operating within 16GB RAM constraints, making it suitable for production deployment in resource-constrained environments.
